00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.720
react is a javascript library for building

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.799
user interfaces developed at facebook

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.799
and released in 2013 it's safe to say

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:08.639
react has been the most influential ui

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.800
library of recent memory we use it to

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.799
build components that represent logical

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.120
reusable parts of the ui the beauty of

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.119
react is that the simplicity of building

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.880
a component has been brought down to its

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.560
theoretical minimum it's just a

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.960
javascript function it's so easy a

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.800
caveman could do it the return value

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.279
from this function is your html or ui

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:29.119
which is written in a special syntax

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:31.039
called jsx allowing you to easily

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:33.600
combine javascript with html markup if

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.280
you want to pass data into a component

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.040
you simply pass it a props argument

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.399
which you can then reference inside the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.040
function body or in the ui using braces

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.920
if the value changes react will react to

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.760
update the ui if we want to give our

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:47.680
component its own internal state we can

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.760
use the state hook the hook is just a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.920
function that returns a value as well as

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.920
a function to change the value in this

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.239
case count is our reactive state and

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.239
setcount will change the state when used

00:00:58.239 --> 00:00:59.920
in the template the count will always

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.520
show the most recent value then we can

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.359
bind set count to a button click event

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.600
so the user can change the state react

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.960
provides a variety of other built-in

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.040
hooks to handle common use cases but the

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.560
main reason you might want to use react

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.080
is not the library itself but the

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.000
massive ecosystem that surrounds it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
react itself doesn't care about routing

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.840
state management animation or anything

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.920
like that instead it lets those concerns

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.600
evolve naturally within the open source

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.960
community no matter what you're trying

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.560
to do there's very likely a good

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.080
supporting library to help you get it

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.320
done need a static site you have gatsby

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.159
need server side rendering you have next

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.079
for animation you have spring for forums

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.840
you have formic state management you've

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.400
got redux mobx flux recoil x state and

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.840
more you have an endless supply of

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.439
choices to get things done the way you

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.439
like it as an added bonus once you have

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:43.280
reactdown you can easily jump into react

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.040
native and start building mobile apps

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.640
and it's no surprise that knowing this

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.320
little ui library is one of the most

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.680
in-demand skills for front-end

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.759
developers today this has been react in

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.360
